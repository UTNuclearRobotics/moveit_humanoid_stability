# MoveIt! Humanoid Stability

Center of mass stability predicate for robots with one or more fixed feet based on KDL: center of mass, (static) stability, and support polygon computations.

Mostly a simple wrapper for [hrl_kinematics](https://github.com/ahornung/hrl_kinematics).

Developed by [Dave Coleman](http://dav.ee) and Shintaro Noda at JSK, University of Tokyo.

## Limitations / Future Work

 - Improve conversion of joint states from MoveIt! to KDL
